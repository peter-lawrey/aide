AIDE brings together the agility of AI-powered code generation with the reliability of Documentation-Driven Development. AIDE is Artificial Intelligence Development Environment relies on AsciiDoc for rich documentation and document context uploads to keep your team and AI tooling aligned.

AIDE focuses on two principles:

1. Use AI for repetitive code tasks such as keeping adoc, code, and tests in sync.
2. Keep requirements, tests, and code in sync with AsciiDoc.

== Iterative Workflow

Development follows a simple loop:

1. **Document Requirements** – Write or update features in AsciiDoc so everyone understands goals. These can be derived and updated from code and tests as these change. This can be as much or as little detail as you have. You can start by asking the AI to generate a detail functional requirements document from code you have or an idea.
2. **Write or Update Tests** – Create tests that reflect documented requirements. AI can suggest skeletons; you refine domain logic.
3. **Write or Update Code** – Let AI produce boilerplate or refactor existing code. You verify its validity.
4. **Continuous Review** – AI flags discrepancies; humans resolve them.
5. **Repeat** – Each new or changed requirement triggers another loop.

== AI <-> Human Collaboration

- **AI**: Proposes repetitive code, test stubs, or refactors.
- **Human**: Reviews correctness, ensures domain fit, finalises decisions.
- **Outcome**: Software matches documented requirements and passes tests.

== Elevating the Workflow with Real-Time Documentation

Building upon our existing Iterative Workflow, the newest recommendation is to emphasise *real-time updates* to documentation. As soon as features, requirements, or tests change, ensure the relevant `.adoc` files are updated. This tight loop not only informs the AI but also creates immediate clarity for all team members.

=== Benefits
- **Confidence in Documentation**: As the newest post highlights, accurate docs keep you from “miscommunications” that derail real-world outcomes.
- **Better Onboarding**: An up-to-date AsciiDoc set means new developers grasp the system’s design and requirements more quickly.
- **Incremental Changes**: Thanks to the incremental mode, AIDE flags any newly updated files so you can keep the documentation in sync.

== Benefits of Keeping Requirements, Tests, and Code In Sync

- **Reduced Drift**: Fewer gaps between what’s documented and what’s implemented.
- **Faster Feedback**: AI can quickly generate stubs and highlight inconsistencies.
- **Better Quality**: Frequent checks keep the code aligned with tests and docs.
- **Smoother Onboarding**: Up-to-date AsciiDoc clarifies the system for new developers.

== Best Practices

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   Keep docs (AsciiDoc), tests, and code together in version control.

2. **Frequent Iterations**
   Update documentation first, then let AI produce or refine code and tests.

3. **Small Commits**
   Each commit should relate to a single requirement or story, making changes easier to review.

4. **Team Buy-In**
   Encourage everyone to review AI outputs. Use consistent coding style, guided by the style guide.

== Summarising Large Files

When a code or test file grows very large, it can complicate AI-based reviews or exceed token limits. AIDE allows you to generate a condensed `.ad` summary for these files. This step is especially useful for rarely updated classes or tests that do not need frequent in-depth reference.

Here is the recommended process:

1. **Identify Large Files**
   Track files that exceed a certain token threshold (as noted in `notes-on-using-aide.adoc`), or are not actively changing.
2. **Use AI to Summarise**
   Run the “Summarise this class as an adoc” command or an equivalent script/tool. This produces a concise `.ad` file containing essential details.
3. **Commit**
   Include a concise commit message like "Summarise large class as `.ad` to reduce token length."

This approach keeps your AI-based tooling efficient and your repository lean, while preserving a high-level understanding of classes that do not require frequent full-detail scrutiny.

== Conclusion

AIDE streamlines development by pairing AI’s efficiency with clear human guidance. Document requirements, run AI-driven code generation, verify via tests, and repeat in small steps. This keeps your project consistent, accurate, and easy to maintain.
