== Overview

This document defines the overall requirements for generating a consolidated, token-optimized project context optimized for downstream ingestion by AI chat applications. File inclusion is strictly controlled by consulting an ignore file (`aide.ignore` or `.gitignore`) along with non-configurable defaults for hidden and binary files. The output is optimized for minimal token usage.

== 1. Output Generation

- The tool always produces an output file optimized for chat ingestion.
- All processing (summarization and token optimization) is designed solely for chat usage.
- The output document **SHOULD** begin with a metadata header summarizing key statistics (total line count, token count, tokens per line).

== 2. File Filtering via Ignore Files

=== 2.1 Primary Check – `aide.ignore` or `.gitignore`
- The tool **MUST** check for an `aide.ignore` file first.
- If not present, it **MUST** use the `.gitignore` file.
- Explicit inclusion/exclusion rules in these files determine file processing.

=== 2.2 Default Behavior When No Rule Exists
- Include all text files by default, except:
- Files with names beginning with a dot.
- Files in dot-prefixed directories.
- Files detected as binary, too large, or with disallowed extensions.
- Files replaced by companion summary files (with a `.ad` extension).

== 3. Modular and Summarized Documentation

- Documentation **SHOULD** be divided into modular units so that only the most relevant content is packaged.
- Each module **MUST** include a brief summary if the document is too large.
- The final output **MUST** be token-optimized by summarizing large documents while retaining essential context.

== 4. Consistent Formatting for Ingestion

- Each file or module **MUST** be clearly separated with standard headings (e.g., “== File: [filename]”) for easy parsing.
- Nonessential formatting (overly detailed layout instructions, extraneous images, copyright metadata) **MUST** be removed.
- The output should be optimized for chat ingestion by minimizing token usage while preserving key context.

== 5. Logging, Error Handling, and Fallback Mechanisms

- The tool **MUST** log detailed decisions regarding file inclusion/exclusion (via a `-Dverbose` option).
- If a file is too large, unreadable, or binary, a warning **MUST** be logged and an indication inserted into the output.

== 6. Discussion of Benefits

- **Enhanced Debugging:**
Detailed logging allows users to trace which files were processed or omitted.
- **Optimized Output:**
Token optimization minimizes unnecessary content, ensuring efficient AI chat ingestion.
- **Modular Structure:**
Clear sectioning improves both human and AI parsing of documentation.
- **Efficient Handling:**
Configurable thresholds ensure large projects are processed efficiently without overwhelming downstream systems.

== 7. Summary

The AdocDocumentApp utility **MUST** generate a consolidated, token-optimized AsciiDoc file for project context ingestion. File inclusion is determined by ignore file rules (or defaults when none exist), ensuring that only relevant files are included. Detailed logging and metadata headers facilitate debugging and provide insight into the packaged documentation’s scope and structure.
