== Code of Conduct

We expect contributors to follow a simple, respectful code of conduct, maintaining a positive environment for everyone. Please be kind, constructive, and inclusive.

== How to Contribute

=== 1. Reporting Issues

* Check the existing issues to see if your problem or request has already been logged.
* If not, create a new issue. Please provide clear steps to reproduce (for bugs) or a rationale (for feature requests).

=== 2. Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome new ideas or improvements:
* Propose them via a GitHub issue labeled with `enhancement`.
* Provide as much context as possible (use cases, examples, or references).

=== 3. Contributing Code

==== 3.1 Fork and Clone

----
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/my-ai-tools.git
cd my-ai-tools
----

==== 3.2 Build and Test

Depending on your build tool:

*Maven Example*:
----
mvn clean package
mvn test
----

*Gradle Example*:
----
gradle clean build
gradle test
----

Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.

==== 3.3 Branching Strategy

* Create a new branch for each feature or fix:
----
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
----
* Keep commits atomic and well-described.

==== 3.4 Code Style & Guidelines

* We use the style guidelines described in `docs/style-guides/coding-style.adoc`.
* All new Java classes must include Javadoc on public methods, plus unit tests in `src/test/`.
* If your change affects usage or architecture, update or add AsciiDoc files in `docs/`.

NOTE: If your work touches `AdocDocumentContext` (or any scanning/summary logic), please confirm or update references to line, blank line, token, and tokens/line counting so the documentation stays consistent.

==== 3.5 Submitting a Pull Request

* Push your branch to your fork:
----
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
----
* Open a PR in GitHub against the `main` (or `dev`) branch of this repository.
* Fill out the PR template, linking issues if relevant, and provide an overview of changes.
* Wait for review. Please address reviewer feedback promptly.

== Test Coverage

* Write unit tests for new or changed logic.
* If youâ€™re adding new features, create matching integration tests.
* Aim for coverage that ensures critical logic is well-tested.

== Documentation Updates

If your contribution changes how the library is used or modifies major functionality, **update** the relevant AsciiDoc files in `docs/`:
* For major changes to requirements, see `docs/requirements/`.
* For usage instructions, see `docs/usage-templates/`.
* For prompt-related updates, see `docs/prompts/`.

== Contact

For any questions before creating a PR, feel free to open a draft PR or start a discussion. We look forward to your contributions!
