== Overview

This document defines the requirements for the AdocDocumentStats class, which aggregates statistics during the packaging process. In the updated design, the class is only required to maintain a single counter for the total number of lines (i.e. all lines are counted together) rather than tracking blank and non-blank lines separately. Token counting and snapshot/delta functionality remain unchanged.

== 1. Total Line Count

- The class **MUST** maintain a counter for the total number of lines processed.
- The counter **MUST** be updated only when a complete line (terminated by a newline character) is received.
- **There is NO separate tracking** for blank lines versus non-blank lines; every complete line increments the same counter.

== 2. Token Counting

- The class **MUST** count the total number of tokens in the processed text.
- Token counting is performed on complete chunks of text once a newline is encountered.
- The token count remains independent of the line count.

== 3. Snapshot and Delta Calculation

- The class **MUST** support snapshot functionality that records the current total line count and token count.
- Delta values are computed by subtracting the snapshot from the current totals.
- Calculations and reporting use only the total line count (not separate blank/non-blank counts).

== 4. Efficiency and Accuracy

- The implementation **SHOULD** process text in chunks (for example, when a newline is encountered) to update the total counts efficiently.
- The total line and token counts **MUST** be accurate, as these values are used for reporting and to drive further processing.

== Summary

The AdocDocumentStats class is responsible for tracking the overall statistics of the processed documentation. In this updated design, only a single total line count is maintained—replacing the previous separate counters for blank and non-blank lines—while token counting and snapshot/delta functionality remain intact. This simplified approach reduces complexity and focuses on the overall volume of text.
