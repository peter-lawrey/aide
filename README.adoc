== Introduction

AIDE (Artificial Intelligence Development Environment) pairs AI-driven code generation with a documentation-driven workflow.
It uses AsciiDoc as a single source of truth so requirements, tests, and code stay in sync.
AI handles repetitive tasks, while humans add domain insight and validate correctness.

For details on iterative development principles and AI-human collaboration, see the <<aide-workflow,AIDE Workflow>>.

== Project Overview

This repository is a “Chronicle Build” sandbox for AI-based tools in Java.
Key features include:

- **GPT-like Token Counting** via the `com.knuddels.jtokkit` library (using `O200K_BASE`) to measure line and token usage more accurately than naive whitespace splitting.
- **AutoCloseable Engine**: Our `AdocDocumentEngine` implements `AutoCloseable`, allowing safer resource cleanup and improved reliability.
- **Template Management** to handle AI prompt templates and text blocks.
- **Documentation-Driven Development** to keep the code in sync with AsciiDoc requirements.
- **Project Statistics** summarising text density and automatically substituting “full” `.adoc` with `.ad` versions when available.

Additional guidelines for coding conventions and commit messages can be found in the <<aide-style-guide,AIDE Style Guide>>.
Definitions of AI and domain terms appear in the <<aide-glossary,AIDE Glossary>>.

=== Highlight This Project as an Example

This project itself demonstrates a real application of AI-enhanced, documentation-driven workflows.
Each `.adoc` file outlines the architecture and best practices, and the incremental build approach <<aide-workflow>> lets you see how newly added or changed requirements become part of the final `increment.asciidoc`.

This makes it easier to:

- Understand how the “document-first” approach is used in practice.
- See concrete code and tests aligning with updated `.adoc` specs.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Java 11 or higher (recommended)
* Maven for building and testing

=== Installation

==== Clone the Repository

----
git clone https://github.com/peter-lawrey/aide.git
cp aide
cp -r aide {your-project-directory}
mvn install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.tools.dc.AsciidocDocumentApp" -Dexec.args="{your-project-directory}"
----

Post to your chat App the following command:

----
Consider the following project directory and reply Got it

<<Paste the project directory here>>
----

Expected Response: "Got it"

or to get started

----
Suggest improvements to this project

<<Paste the project directory here>>
----

==== Build the Project

----
mvn clean package
----

=== Basic Usage

* **AdocDocumentApp** Utility
Recursively scans directories, applying filters to list `.adoc`, `pom.xml`, or `src/` files.
It calculates line counts, blank lines, total tokens, and tokens/line.
Results are summarised at the end.

I run `AdocDocumentApp` with a directory path as an argument in my IDE.
However, you can run it from maven or on the command line.

- Replaces “full” files with `.ad` summaries when available.
- Excludes files and directories from `.gitignore`
- Excludes `.asciidoc`, hidden files, PDFs, and images.
- Aggregates stats (including GPT-like token counts) at the end.

== Example AI Prompts

Below are sample prompts you can give to a Chat App for `context.asciidoc` including AIDE, along with the kind of response you might expect.
In each case paste the `context.asciidoc` into the Chat App and see what it generates.

[source]
----
Consider the following project and reply Got it

<<Paste the context.asciidoc here>>
----

Expected Response: "Got it"

'''

[source]
----
Prompt: "Please generate a Java class `MyService` that reads user data from a file, logs results, and returns a status code."
----

Expected (Summary of AI Response):

- The AI might produce a fully fleshed-out `MyService.java` with `readUserData`, `logResults`, and `getStatusCode` methods.
- It should use camelCase for methods, a short 4-space indentation, and document each public method with Javadoc.
- If the AI omits certain details (like exception handling), the developer should refine the prompt or manually enhance the code.

'''

[source]
----
Prompt: "Summarise the file `HugeFeatureClass.java` as `.ad` so we reduce token usage. Provide only method signatures and a high-level overview of each method’s role."
----

Expected (Summary of AI Response):

- The AI returns a minimal `.ad` document with headings for each method signature and bullet points for key functionalities.
- The total text is significantly smaller than the full `.java` content.

Describe this image as asciidoc

<<Paste the image here>>

Expected (Summary of AI Response):

This is a close-up photo of dark-brown vanilla pods and roasted coffee beans on a warm, rustic wooden surface.
Some beans are cracked to show their lighter interiors, and the wood’s natural grain and knots create a cozy backdrop.
Overall, it highlights the rich, earthy tones of the vanilla and coffee, evoking their combined aromatic appeal.
