== Purpose

This AsciiDoc document describes all classes under the package `build.chronicle.aide.dc` and the relationships between them.
It provides enough details for an AI (or a developer) to recreate the Java source code files entirely.

== Overview

The `build.chronicle.aide.dc` package orchestrates the scanning and processing of AsciiDoc or text-based files, computes statistics (lines, blank lines, tokens), and merges contents into one or more AsciiDoc outputs.

It supports:

1. **Full Context Mode** – Produce a new `context.asciidoc` if one doesn't exist.
2. **Incremental Mode** – If `context.asciidoc` already exists, only new or updated files are appended to `increment.asciidoc`, drastically reducing redundant processing. This speeds up iterative development, as older files are not reprocessed unless modified.
3. **Filtering** – Excludes certain files (hidden, images, overshadowed by `.ad`, etc.) and optionally excludes large files.
4. **Token Counting** – Uses a GPT-like encoder (`com.knuddels.jtokkit`, with `O200K_BASE`) to count tokens.

The following classes each serve a distinct responsibility:


link:adoc-document-app.adoc[]

link:adoc-document-engine.adoc[]

link:adoc-file-filter-req.adoc[]

link:adoc-contextual-search.adoc[]

link:adoc-document-stats.adoc[]

link:adoc-document-writer.adoc[]

link:adoc-file-processor-req.adoc[]

link:adoc-file-processor-req.adoc[]

link:adoc-decisions-log.adoc[]

== Relationships and Flow

1. **AdocDocumentApp:**
   Instantiates the engine and related collaborators, sets options (including search patterns), and triggers the execution flow.
2. **AdocDocumentEngine:**
   Handles directory scanning, mode detection (full vs. incremental), and delegates file processing. Output is written using markdown-style headings.
3. **AdocFileFilter, AdocDocumentWriter, AdocDocumentStats, AdocFileProcessor:**
   Work together to filter files, write output, maintain statistics, and process file contents respectively.

Please provide the **entire** source code for all classes in one response.

Use this exact block as a starting prompt for your AI-based code generation.
Ensure the final classes compile and fulfill the requirements above.

=== Best Practices for Re-Generating Code

When you modify class responsibilities or rename methods:

- **Update this `.adoc` file** first, to reflect new or changed requirements.
- Use the prompt block below to request the AI to regenerate any or all classes that have changed significantly.
- Always review generated code before committing to ensure domain-specific logic remains correct.

== Appendix: Example Usage

1. **Full Run**
`java -cp aide-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build.chronicle.aide.dc.AdocDocumentApp .`

2. **Incremental Update**
- Make changes to `.adoc` or code, ensuring `context.asciidoc` is present.
- Run again with your updated paths:
`java -cp aide-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build.chronicle.aide.dc.AdocDocumentApp .`

3. **Review**
Inspect `increment.asciidoc` for newly added content.
