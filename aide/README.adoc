This folder contains supplemental AsciiDoc files that guide usage, workflows, or style conventions for AI-based projects.

== Overview

----
aide/
├─ aide-glossary.adoc       → Terminology definitions
├─ aide-style-guide.adoc    → Project coding style guidelines
├─ aide-workflow.adoc       → AI workflow explanation
├─ examples.adoc            → Examples using AI
└─ notes-on-using-aide.adoc → Notes on using AIDE
----

Refer to each `.adoc` for details:

* xref:aide-glossary.adoc[AIDE Glossary]: Definitions of key terms (tokens, AIDE, tokens/line, etc.).
* xref:aide-style-guide.adoc[AIDE Style Guide]: Conventions for naming, coding, and documentation.
* xref:aide-workflow.adoc[AIDE Workflow]: The AIDE approach to iterative, documentation-driven engineering.
* xref:notes-on-using-aide.adoc[Notes on Using AIDE]: Revision notes and ideas for improvements.
* xref:examples.adoc[Examples using AIDE]: Sample AI queries and examples.

These documents are stored in version control alongside the code, ensuring they evolve together.

== Usage

Many of these `.adoc` files are included in the final context file (e.g. `context.asciidoc` or `increment.asciidoc`) used for project queries and reference. Keep them as small as practical to avoid exceeding token limits in AI-driven tasks.
