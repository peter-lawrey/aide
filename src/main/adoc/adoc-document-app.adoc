== Overview

This document defines the requirements for generating a consolidated project context that is optimized for ingestion by downstream processes. File inclusion is strictly controlled by first consulting the ignore file—using `aide.ignore` if it exists or falling back to `.gitignore`—and then applying non-configurable default rules. In addition, files detected as binary, too large, or matching specific extensions are automatically excluded.

== File Filtering via Ignore Files

**Primary Check – `aide.ignore` or `.gitignore`:**

- The tool **MUST** first check for an `aide.ignore` file.
- If an `aide.ignore` file is not present, the tool **MUST** fall back to the `.gitignore` file.
- If the ignore file explicitly **excludes** a file, that file is excluded.
- If the ignore file explicitly **includes** a file, that file is included and subsequent local checks are bypassed.

**Default Behavior When No Rule Exists:**

- In the absence of an explicit rule, the default is to include all text files.
- However, the following rules are non-configurable:
- Files whose names start with a dot (`.`) are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- Files located under any directory that starts with a dot (`.`) are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- The tool **MUST** detect binary files (e.g. via content analysis or MIME type) and exclude them.
- Files exceeding a configurable size threshold are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- Files ending with the extensions `.asciidoc` or `.adoc` are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- For any file, if a companion file exists with the same name plus a `.ad` extension, then that summary file **REPLACES** the original file for packaging purposes.

== Modular and Summarized Documentation

- Documentation **SHOULD** be organized into modular units so that only the most relevant content is packaged.
- Each module or file section **MUST** include a brief summary at its start if the original document is too large to be included in full.
- The output file must be token-optimized by automatically summarizing large documents.

== Consistent Formatting for Ingestion

- Each included file or module **MUST** be clearly separated using standard headings (e.g., “== File: [filename]”) for easy parsing.
- Nonessential formatting—such as overly detailed layout instructions, extraneous image references, and copyright metadata—
**MUST** be removed.
- The final output should be formatted in a manner that minimizes token usage while preserving the essential context.

== Output Enhancements and Summary Information

- The generated output file **SHOULD** begin with a summary header that includes key statistics (e.g. total line count, token count, and a brief table of contents).
- This summary enables a quick understanding of the scope and structure of the packaged documentation.

== Logging, Error Handling, and Fallback Mechanisms

- The tool **MUST** log detailed information about file inclusion/exclusion decisions to facilitate debugging (a `-Dverbose` option may be used to enable verbose logging).
- If a file is too large, unreadable, or detected as binary, a warning **MUST** be logged and a brief note inserted into the output indicating that the section was omitted.
- The output **SHOULD** clearly indicate any omissions resulting from filtering.

== Summary

The AdocDocumentApp utility **MUST** generate a consolidated, token-optimized AsciiDoc file for project context ingestion. File inclusion is determined by first consulting the `aide.ignore` file (or falling back to `.gitignore` if needed). If the ignore file explicitly excludes or includes a file, that decision is final. In the absence of an explicit rule, all text files are included by default—except for those whose names begin with a dot or that reside in dot-prefixed directories, or any file detected as binary or too large or with a disallowed extension (with summary files taking precedence). These requirements ensure that the final packaged documentation is lean, focused, and ideally suited for ingestion by downstream processes.
