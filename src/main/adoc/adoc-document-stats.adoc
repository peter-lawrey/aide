== Overview

This document defines the requirements for the **AdocDocumentStats** class, which aggregates statistics during the packaging process. In the updated design, the class maintains a single counter for the total number of lines (without differentiating blank vs. non-blank) while retaining token counting and snapshot/delta functionality.

== 1. Total Line Count
- **MUST** maintain a counter for the total number of processed lines.
- **MUST** update the counter only when a complete line (terminated by a newline) is received.
- **NO** separate tracking for blank versus non-blank lines.

== 2. Token Counting
- **MUST** count the total number of tokens in the processed text.
- Token counting occurs on complete chunks of text once a newline is encountered.
- The token count is independent of the line count.

== 3. Snapshot and Delta Calculation
- **MUST** support snapshot functionality to record the current line and token counts.
- Delta values are computed by subtracting the snapshot totals from the current counts.

== 4. Efficiency and Accuracy
- The implementation **SHOULD** process text in chunks (e.g., when a newline is encountered) for efficiency.
- The total line and token counts **MUST** be accurate, as they drive subsequent processing and reporting.

== Summary

The **AdocDocumentStats** class provides simplified yet accurate tracking of documentation statistics, focusing solely on the overall text volume and token counts.
