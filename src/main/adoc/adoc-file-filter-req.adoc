== Overview

This document describes the requirements for the **AdocFileFilter** component, which encapsulates the rules for including or excluding files based on multiple criteria such as ignore files, hidden status, file size, and companion files.

== Responsibilities

1. **Check `.gitignore` or `aide.ignore`**
- Use **GitignoreFilter** to determine if a file is explicitly *ignored* or *included*.
- If the ignore file returns `IGNORED`, skip the file immediately.
- If it returns `NOT_IGNORED`, include the file and bypass further checks.
- If `DEFAULT`, proceed with local checks.

2. **Skip Directories**
- Always return `false` for directories (handled by the engine).

3. **Skip Hidden or Dot Files**
- Exclude files that are hidden or have names starting with a dot.

4. **Overshadowed by Companion Summary**
- Exclude a file if a companion file with the same name plus a `.ad` extension exists.

5. **Exclude Certain Extensions**
- Skip files with disallowed extensions (e.g., `.asciidoc`, image formats, binary types).

6. **Exclude Files with Specific Prefixes**
- For example, files starting with `out-` are excluded.

7. **Size Limit Check**
- Exclude files larger than 128 KB (or if the size cannot be determined).

== Usage Flow
1. **Construction:** Optionally supply an ignore file path. If parsing fails, run without ignore file checks.
2. **Filtering:** For each file:
- Check if itâ€™s a directory (return `false`).
- Check ignore file results.
- Apply local checks (hidden, overshadow, extension, prefix, size).
3. **Integration:** Used by **AdocDocumentEngine** during directory traversal.

== Key Methods
- `AdocFileFilter(Path ignoreFilePath)`
- `boolean include(Path path)`

== Test Coverage Summary
- Verifies correct integration with ignore files.
- Checks that hidden files, overshadowed files, and disallowed extensions are excluded.
- Ensures size limits and prefix rules are enforced.

== Summary

The **AdocFileFilter** ensures that only relevant and manageable files are processed by applying a layered set of checks, prioritizing ignore file results and enforcing local filtering rules.
