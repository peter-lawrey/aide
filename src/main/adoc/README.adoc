== Introduction

This repository contains the complete, chat-optimized requirements for the AIDE toolset. The documentation is organized into modular units so that each component of the system is clearly defined and can be easily maintained or extended. The files have been structured with clear headings and cross-references to improve both human readability and AI processing (e.g. by GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT).
