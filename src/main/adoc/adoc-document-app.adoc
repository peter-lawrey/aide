== Overview

This document defines the requirements for generating a consolidated project context optimized for ingestion by downstream processes. File inclusion is controlled by consulting an ignore file (preferably `aide.ignore`, or `.gitignore` if absent) and applying strict default rules. The output is token‑optimized for AI ingestion.

== 1. File Filtering via Ignore Files

=== Primary Check – `aide.ignore` or `.gitignore`
- The tool **MUST** check for an `aide.ignore` file.
- If absent, the tool **MUST** fall back to the `.gitignore` file.
- If the ignore file explicitly **excludes** a file, that file is omitted.
- If explicitly **included**, the file bypasses further checks.

=== Default Behavior
- In the absence of an explicit rule, include all text files except:
- Files starting with a dot (`.`) or in dot-prefixed directories.
- Files detected as binary, overly large, or with disallowed extensions (e.g., `.asciidoc`, `.adoc`).
- Files with a companion summary (with a `.ad` extension) replace the original.

== 2. Modular and Summarized Documentation

- Documentation **SHOULD** be organized into modular units.
- Each module **MUST** include a brief summary at its start if the original document is too large.
- The final output file **MUST** be token-optimized by summarizing large documents while retaining essential context.

== 3. Consistent Formatting for Ingestion

- Each included file **MUST** be clearly separated (using headings like “== File: [filename]”) for easy parsing.
- Nonessential formatting (e.g., extraneous layout instructions or metadata) **MUST** be removed.
- The output should be formatted to minimize token usage while preserving context.

== 4. Output Enhancements and Summary Information

- The generated output **SHOULD** begin with a summary header that includes key statistics (total lines, token count, tokens per line).

== 5. Logging, Error Handling, and Fallback Mechanisms

- The tool **MUST** log detailed file inclusion/exclusion decisions (via a `-Dverbose` option).
- If a file is too large, unreadable, or binary, a warning **MUST** be logged and a note inserted in the output.

== Summary

The AdocDocumentApp utility **MUST** generate a consolidated, token-optimized AsciiDoc file for project context ingestion. Decisions are finalized by the ignore file rules, ensuring that only relevant text files are included.
