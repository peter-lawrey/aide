== Overview

This document defines the requirements for the **AdocFileProcessor** component, which is responsible for reading file contents (in UTF-8) and optionally removing copyright comment blocks if they appear within the first 20 lines.

== Methods and Usage

=== 1. readFileLines(Path file) throws IOException
- Reads all lines from the specified file in UTF-8 encoding.
- Returns a list of strings (one per line).

=== 2. maybeRemoveCopyright(List<String> lines)
- Scans the first 20 lines for recognized copyright markers.
- If a block is found (using supported comment styles), removes the entire block.
- Returns the modified list; if no block is found, returns the original list.

== Copyright Removal Logic

Supported styles include:

=== AsciiDoc Comment Block
- Recognized by `////` delimiters.
- If a block containing “Copyright” is detected before line 20, all lines in the block (including delimiters) are removed.

=== Java Block Comment
- Recognized by `/*` ... `*/`.
- If the block contains “Copyright” and is within the first 20 lines, it is entirely removed.

=== Forward-Slash Line Comments
- Consecutive lines starting with `//` that contain “Copyright” are removed.

=== Shell Script (`#`) Comments
- Consecutive lines starting with `#` (excluding shebang `#!`) that include “Copyright” are removed.

== Test Scenarios
- No copyright block – file remains unchanged.
- Removal of a recognized block (AsciiDoc, Java, or line comment).
- Ignoring blocks beyond the first 20 lines.

== Future Enhancements
- Configurable markers via external configuration.
- Partial removal or multi-block handling if required.

== Summary

The **AdocFileProcessor** reliably reads file contents and cleans them by removing copyright blocks detected within the first 20 lines, following clearly defined patterns.
