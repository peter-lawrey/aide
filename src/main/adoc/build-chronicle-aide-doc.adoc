== Purpose

This document describes all classes under the package `build.chronicle.aide.dc` and the relationships between them. It provides sufficient details for an AI tool (or a developer) to recreate the Java source code files entirely.

== Overview

The `build.chronicle.aide.dc` package orchestrates the scanning, filtering, processing, and packaging of AsciiDoc or text-based files. It also computes statistics (e.g., lines, tokens) and merges content into one or more AsciiDoc outputs.

== Supported Features
1. **Full Context Mode:**
- Generate a new `context.asciidoc` if one does not exist.
2. **Incremental Mode:**
- Append new or updated files to `increment.asciidoc` if `context.asciidoc` already exists.
3. **Filtering:**
- Exclude hidden files, images, files overshadowed by companion `.ad` files, and overly large files.
4. **Token Counting:**
- Use a GPT-like encoder to count tokens for chat optimization.

== Class Relationships and Flow

- **AdocDocumentApp:**
Instantiates the engine, configures input paths, output files, and options (e.g., search patterns).

- **AdocDocumentEngine:**
Handles directory scanning, mode detection (full vs. incremental), and delegates file processing. It writes output using markdown-style file headings.

- **AdocFileFilter, AdocDocumentWriter, AdocDocumentStats, AdocFileProcessor, AdocContextualSearch:**
Collaborate to filter files, write formatted content, track statistics, process file contents, and extract contextual matches.

== Usage Flow

1. **Initialization:** Instantiate required components and set configuration options.
2. **Input Addition:** Add directories or file paths for scanning.
3. **Execution:** Process files (full or incremental), writing output with clear markdown-style headings and contextual markers.
4. **Summary and Closure:** Append statistics and close the output file.

== Prompt for AI-Based Code Generation

Use the following block as a starting prompt when requesting AI code generation for the classes:

----
Provide the entire source code for all classes under the package `build.chronicle.aide.dc` ensuring they compile and meet the requirements documented herein.
----

== Best Practices for Regenerating Code
- Update this document first to reflect any changes.
- Use the provided prompt block to request regenerated code.
- Always review the generated code before committing.

== Appendix: Example Usage

1. **Full Run:**
`java -cp aide-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build.chronicle.aide.dc.AdocDocumentApp .`
2. **Incremental Update:**
Make changes and run:
`java -cp aide-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build.chronicle.aide.dc.AdocDocumentApp .`
3. **Review:**
Inspect `increment.asciidoc` for newly added content.

== Summary

This document outlines the complete requirements for the `build.chronicle.aide.dc` package, detailing class responsibilities, interactions, and best practices for AI-based code generation.
