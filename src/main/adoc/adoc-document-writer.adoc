= AdocDocumentWriter

This component is responsible for writing processed text to the output AsciiDoc file while updating statistics (such as total lines and tokens) on a per-line basis. In the updated implementation, the writer also ensures that each file section is clearly delimited for downstream AI ingestion by inserting markdown-style file headings and contextual search markers.

== Fields

- **AdocDocumentStats stats**
Tracks and updates the total number of lines and tokens in the output.

- **PrintWriter currentWriter**
The active writer used to append text to the output file.

== Behavior

- **open(String outputFile, boolean append):**
- Opens (or creates) the output file specified by the path.
- The `append` parameter controls whether existing content is overwritten or preserved.

- **write(String text):**
- Writes the provided text to the currently open file.
- Invokes `stats.updateStats(text)` to update line and token counts.
- When beginning a new file section (e.g. when processing a new source file), a markdown-style heading (e.g. “# File: relative/path/to/file”) is output before the file’s content.
- If contextual search is active, matching segments are preceded by a marker such as “.lines [start, end]” indicating the range of lines in the original file.

- **snapshotStats():**
- Captures a snapshot of the current statistics so that subsequent writes can report changes (deltas) in lines and tokens.

- **close():**
- Closes the current writer, ensuring all buffered output is flushed to disk.

== Usage

The writer is typically used by the AdocDocumentEngine during processing:
- At the start, the engine opens the output file (e.g. `context.asciidoc` for full mode or `increment.asciidoc` for incremental mode) via `open()`.
- A header (e.g. “= Directory Content”) is written to the output.
- For each file processed, the engine writes a markdown-style heading (e.g. “# File: relative/path/to/file”) before the file’s content.
- When a search pattern is active, any matching segments are marked with a “.lines [start, end]” header before their respective content blocks.
- After processing, `snapshotStats()` is used to capture current counts and a summary block is appended.
- Finally, `close()` is called to complete the output process.

== Summary

The AdocDocumentWriter ensures that the final packaged output is clear, structured, and optimized for ingestion by downstream AI chat systems. By incorporating markdown-style file headings and contextual search markers, the output is not only token-optimized but also easy to parse and understand.
