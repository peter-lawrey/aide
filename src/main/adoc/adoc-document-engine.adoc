== Overview

The **AdocDocumentEngine** is the central orchestrator responsible for scanning directories, filtering files, processing file content, and writing the consolidated AsciiDoc output. It supports both full and incremental modes and integrates with components like **AdocContextualSearch**, **AdocFileFilter**, **AdocFileProcessor**, **AdocDocumentWriter**, and **AdocDocumentStats**.

== Responsibilities

1. **Mode Detection**
- Determine full mode if `context.asciidoc` does not exist.
- Switch to incremental mode if `context.asciidoc` exists (process only new/updated files).

2. **Console Output**
- Print the mode before opening the output file:
- “Full mode: context.asciidoc”
- “Incremental mode: increment.asciidoc”

3. **File Scanning**
- Recursively traverse directories.
- Use **AdocFileFilter** to decide file inclusion.
- In incremental mode, compare file modification timestamps.

4. **File Processing**
- Read file content using **AdocFileProcessor** (UTF-8).
- Optionally remove copyright blocks.
- If a search pattern is set, delegate to **AdocContextualSearch** to extract matching segments with context.
- Write file content preceded by a markdown-style header (e.g., “# File: relative/path/to/file”) and, if applicable, a “.lines [start, end]” marker.

5. **Statistics & Summaries**
- Maintain and update global counters (total lines and tokens) via **AdocDocumentStats**.
- Append a summary block at the end showing statistics and any skipped files.

6. **Error Handling**
- Log and skip unreadable or problematic files.

== 2. Integration with Other Components

- **AdocDocumentApp:** Instantiates and configures the engine.
- **AdocFileFilter:** Determines file eligibility.
- **AdocFileProcessor:** Reads and cleans file content.
- **AdocDocumentWriter:** Outputs the processed content.
- **AdocDocumentStats:** Tracks statistics.
- **AdocContextualSearch:** Processes file content when a search pattern is provided.

== 3. Usage Flow

1. **Initialization:** Instantiate the engine with required collaborators and configuration options.
2. **Input Path Addition:** Add directories or file paths.
3. **Execution:** Check for an existing `context.asciidoc` to set mode, open the output file, and process each eligible file.
4. **Summary and Closure:** Append statistics and close the output file.

== 4. Error Handling and Logging

- Detailed verbose logging (enabled via `-Dverbose`) for file inclusion/exclusion, mode detection, and errors.
- Record skipped files in the final summary.

== Summary

The updated **AdocDocumentEngine** efficiently generates a chat-optimized AsciiDoc file by combining directory traversal, filtering, and per-file content extraction with clear markdown-style delimiters.
