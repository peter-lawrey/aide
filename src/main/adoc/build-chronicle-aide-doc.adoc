== Purpose

This AsciiDoc document describes all classes under the package `build.chronicle.aide.dc` and the relationships between them.
It provides enough details for an AI (or a developer) to recreate the Java source code files entirely.

== Overview

The `build.chronicle.aide.dc` package orchestrates the scanning and processing of AsciiDoc or text-based files, computes statistics (lines, blank lines, tokens), and merges contents into one or more AsciiDoc outputs.

It supports:

1. **Full Context Mode** – Produce a new `context.asciidoc` if one doesn't exist.
2. **Incremental Mode** – If `context.asciidoc` already exists, only new or updated files are appended to `increment.asciidoc`, drastically reducing redundant processing. This speeds up iterative development, as older files are not reprocessed unless modified.
3. **Filtering** – Excludes certain files (hidden, images, overshadowed by `.ad`, etc.) and optionally excludes large files.
4. **Token Counting** – Uses a GPT-like encoder (`com.knuddels.jtokkit`, with `O200K_BASE`) to count tokens.

The following classes each serve a distinct responsibility:

include::adoc-document-app.adoc[]

include::adoc-document-engine.adoc[]

include::adoc-document-stats.adoc[]

include::adoc-document-writer.adoc[]

include::adoc-file-filer-req.adoc[]

include::adoc-file-processor-req.adoc[]

== 7. Relationships and Flow

1. **`AdocDocumentApp`**:
- Instantiates `AdocDocumentEngine` and related classes.
- Sets properties (context, increment, removeCopyright).
- Calls `engine.execute()`, `engine.printSummary()`, `engine.close()`.
2. **`AdocDocumentEngine`**:
- Manages scanning, incremental detection, and calls `processFile(path)` as needed.
- Uses `AdocFileProcessor` to read lines and remove optional blocks.
- Delegates writing to `AdocDocumentWriter`.
- Summarizes lines, blanks, tokens, and logs skipped files.
3. **`AdocFileFilter`**:
- Called to determine if a file is included/excluded by path or extension.
4. **`AdocDocumentWriter`**:
- Receives text from the engine, writes it to file, and updates `AdocDocumentStats`.
5. **`AdocDocumentStats`**:
- Tracks global counters for lines, blanks, tokens (via GPT-like encoding).
- Deltas are used for per-file or partial file stats.
6. **`AdocFileProcessor`**:
- Abstracts file I/O reading and comment-block removal.

== Gitignore Handling

With the latest iteration, `.gitignore` logic returns a `MatchResult`:

- **IGNORED**: `.gitignore` explicitly excludes a file.
- **NOT_IGNORED**: `.gitignore` explicitly reincludes a file via `!pattern`.
- **DEFAULT**: If no rule applies, other filters can finalize the decision.

This helps us chain `.gitignore` with additional custom filters (e.g., overshadow logic, large-file skips).

== 8. Prompt: Recreate All Classes in `build.chronicle.aide.dc`

Add the following AsciiDoc block to request the AI to generate all Java files:

----
You are an advanced AI capable of generating Java source code.
Using the specification in this AsciiDoc (the preceding sections),
**recreate** the following classes under package `build.chronicle.aide.dc`:

1. `AdocDocumentApp.java`
2. `AdocDocumentEngine.java`
3. `AdocDocumentStats.java`
4. `AdocDocumentWriter.java`
5. `AdocFileFilter.java`
6. `AdocFileProcessor.java`

Constraints:

- Each class must be fully self-contained (imports, package declarations, etc.).
- *Include minimal in-code references to the relevant sections of this AsciiDoc* (e.g., `// See AdocDocumentEngine, Section 2.2 for details`)
- Code must compile under Java 11 or higher.
- Ensure the logic matches the stated responsibilities, fields, and methods.
- Provide JavaDocs for the main classes and methods.

Please provide the **entire** source code for all classes in one response.
----

Use this exact block as a starting prompt for your AI-based code generation.
Ensure the final classes compile and fulfill the requirements above.

=== Best Practices for Re-Generating Code

When you modify class responsibilities or rename methods:

- **Update this `.adoc` file** first, to reflect new or changed requirements.
- Use the prompt block below to request the AI to regenerate any or all classes that have changed significantly.
- Always review generated code before committing to ensure domain-specific logic remains correct.

== Appendix: Example Usage

1. **Full Run**
`java -cp aide-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build.chronicle.aide.dc.AdocDocumentApp .`

2. **Incremental Update**
- Make changes to `.adoc` or code, ensuring `context.asciidoc` is present.
- Run again with your updated paths:
`java -cp aide-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build.chronicle.aide.dc.AdocDocumentApp .`

3. **Review**
Inspect `increment.asciidoc` for newly added content.
