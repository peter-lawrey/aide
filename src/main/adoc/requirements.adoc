== Overview

This document defines the requirements for generating a consolidated project context that is optimized for downstream ingestion (especially by AI chat applications).
File inclusion is strictly controlled by consulting an ignore file (either `aide.ignore` or `.gitignore`) in combination with non-configurable default rules for hidden and binary files.
The output is token-optimized to facilitate ingestion by AI systems.

== 1. Output Generation

- The tool always generates an output file that is optimized for ingestion by a chat application.
- All processing—including summarization and token optimization—is designed solely for chat usage.
- The output document **SHOULD** include a metadata header summarizing key statistics (total line count, token count, tokens/line) to give immediate insight into the packaged content.

== 2. File Filtering via Ignore Files

1. **Primary Check – `aide.ignore` or `.gitignore`:**
- The tool **MUST** first check for an `aide.ignore` file.
- If an `aide.ignore` file is not present, the tool **MUST** fall back to the `.gitignore` file.
- If the ignore file explicitly **excludes** a file, that file is excluded.
- If the ignore file explicitly **includes** a file, that file is included and subsequent local checks are bypassed.

2. **Default Behavior When No Rule Exists:**
- In the absence of an explicit rule, the default is to include all text files.
- However, the following rules are non-configurable:
- Files whose names start with a dot (`.`) are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- Files located under any directory that starts with a dot (`.`) are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- The tool **MUST** detect binary files (e.g. via content analysis or MIME type) and exclude them.
- Files that are too large (exceeding a configurable threshold) are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- Files ending in `.asciidoc` or `.adoc` are **ALWAYS** excluded.
- If a companion summary file exists (with a `.ad` extension), it **REPLACES** the original file.

== 3. Modular and Summarized Documentation

- Documentation **SHOULD** be organized into modular units so that only the most relevant content is packaged.
- Each module or file section **MUST** include a brief summary at its start if the original document is too large to include in full.
- The final output file **MUST** be token-optimized by automatically summarizing large documents while retaining the essential context.

== 4. Consistent Formatting for Ingestion

- Each included file or module **MUST** be clearly separated, (e.g., using “== File: [filename]” headings) for easy parsing.
- Nonessential formatting—such as overly detailed layout instructions or extraneous image references—**MUST** be removed to ensure clarity.
- The copyright notice and other metadata **SHOULD** be removed from the output.
- The output should be token-optimized for chat ingestion where possible.

== 5. Output Enhancements and Summary Information

== 5. Logging, Error Handling, and Fallback Mechanisms

- The tool **MUST** log detailed information about file inclusion/exclusion decisions to facilitate debugging.
- A `-Dverbose` command-line option **MUST** be provided.
When enabled, this option activates verbose logging of:
- Filtering decisions based on `.gitignore`/`aide.ignore` rules.
- Local file checks (e.g., hidden files, file size, and extension rules).
- Any errors encountered during file reading or processing.
- If a file is too large, unreadable, or detected as binary, a warning **MUST** be logged and a brief note inserted into the output indicating that the section was omitted.
- The output **SHOULD** clearly indicate any omissions due to filtering.

== 6. Detailed Discussion of Benefits

The following benefits are expected from these enhancements:

- **Enhanced Debugging and Transparency:**
By introducing the `-Dverbose` option, users can trace exactly which files were included or excluded and understand the filtering decisions.
This transparency aids in troubleshooting unexpected omissions or inclusions.

- **Optimized Output for AI Ingestion:**
The token-optimized output minimizes unnecessary content and formatting, ensuring that AI chat applications receive only the most pertinent information, thus reducing processing time and token consumption.

- **Modular Documentation Structure:**
Clear sectioning (e.g., “== File: [filename]” headings) improves readability and parsing by AI systems, which leads to more accurate context interpretation.

- **Efficient Handling of Large Projects:**
With configurable file size thresholds and dynamic summarization, the tool efficiently processes large projects without overwhelming the AI with extraneous details.

- **Improved User Experience:**
The added logging, combined with a clear metadata header summarizing key statistics, allows users to verify the completeness and accuracy of the output, fostering confidence in the packaging process.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:**
The enhancements provide a robust framework that adapts to a wide range of project sizes and complexities, making it easier to maintain consistency between the project documentation and the AI’s understanding.

== 7. Summary

The AdocDocumentApp utility is required to generate a consolidated, token-optimized AsciiDoc file for project context ingestion.
File inclusion is determined by first consulting the `aide.ignore` file (or falling back to `.gitignore` if necessary).
In cases where no explicit rule exists, all text files are included by default—except for files whose names begin with a dot, reside under dot-prefixed directories, are detected as binary, too large, or have disallowed extensions (with summary files taking precedence).
The addition of a `-Dverbose` option and the detailed discussion of benefits ensure that users can debug the process easily and understand the advantages of the new design.
