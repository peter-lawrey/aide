== Overview

This document defines the requirements for implementing a Grep-like contextual search feature in the AIDE toolset. The **AdocContextualSearch** component works in tandem with the **AdocDocumentEngine** to process individual files. When processing a file, the search operation:

* Checks whether the file name matches the search pattern. If so, the entire file content is returned.
* Otherwise, scans the file line-by-line and returns each matching line along with a fixed number of context lines before and after the match.
* Merges overlapping context regions to keep the output concise.
* Marks each matching segment with a “.lines [start, end]” header before outputting the content block.

== Functional Requirements

=== 1. Search Scoping
* The search component **MUST**:
- Accept a regular expression as input.
- Operate on individual files provided by the **AdocDocumentEngine**.
- Return the full file content if the file name matches the search pattern.
- Otherwise, perform line-by-line matching respecting file filtering rules (e.g. aide.ignore, .gitignore, hidden/binary files).

=== 2. Context Retrieval
* The search component **MUST**:
- Allow specification of a fixed number of context lines before (-B) and after (-A) each match.
- Merge overlapping context regions when multiple matches occur.
- Preserve original ordering, formatting, and indentation.
- Return match records that include the file path, the starting and ending line numbers, and a marker indicating direct matches versus context lines.

=== 3. Output Format
* Search results **MUST** be formatted to clearly convey context:
- Each match **MUST** include the file path and line numbers.
- Direct match lines should be clearly distinguished from context lines.
- The output **SHOULD** support at least the following formats:
- Plain text (default)
- AsciiDoc (with proper section headings)
- Markdown
- HTML (with syntax highlighting for code fragments)

=== 4. Integration with AdocDocumentEngine
* The contextual search feature integrates as follows:
- **AdocDocumentEngine** handles directory traversal and file filtering.
- For each file that passes filtering, the engine invokes **AdocContextualSearch**.
- If the file name matches the search pattern, the entire file is returned; otherwise, only matching segments with context are extracted.
- Results are merged into the final output document.

=== 5. Non-Functional Requirements
* The search operation **MUST**:
- Be efficient and capable of handling large files without excessive memory usage.
- Support incremental searching so that unchanged files can reuse previous results.
- Be thread-safe for parallel processing in large codebases.
- Provide clear error handling for files that cannot be processed.

== Summary

The updated contextual search feature enhances the AIDE toolset by focusing on precise file-level search. By separating directory traversal (handled by the engine) from per-file content extraction, the design simplifies implementation, improves performance, and delivers contextually rich search results optimized for downstream AI ingestion.
