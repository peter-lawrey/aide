= AdocFileProcessor

Handles reading file lines in UTF-8 and optionally removing a multi-line or single-line copyright comment block **if it appears within the first 20 lines**.

== Overview

1. **Methods**:
* `List<String> readFileLines(Path file) throws IOException`
- Reads all lines from the given file in UTF-8.
* `List<String> maybeRemoveCopyright(List<String> lines)`
- Searches the first 20 lines for one of the recognised copyright markers
and, if found, removes that block along with any additional lines that form
part of it. Returns the modified list (or original if no match).

2. **Usage**:
- Typical flow:
    * **Read** the file contents via `readFileLines(...)`.
    * **Strip** out a recognized copyright block (if present).
    * **Return** the resulting list of lines.

== Copyright Removal Logic

Based on the parameterized tests, the current implementation handles several comment styles when looking for the word “Copyright” within the first 20 lines:

=== AsciiDoc Comment Block
- Pattern:

[source]
----
////
Copyright (c) ....
[Optional lines...]
////
----

- If this pattern is detected before line 20:
- All lines within this block (including the `////`) are removed.

=== Java Block Comment
- Pattern:

[source]
----
/*
[Optional lines...]
Copyright (c) ...
[Optional lines...]
*/
----
- If it appears within the first 20 lines, all lines from the `/*` up to `*/` (inclusive) are removed.

=== Forward-Slash Line Comment
- Pattern:

`// Copyright (c) ...`

- If found near the top, the block of consecutive `//` lines containing “Copyright” can be stripped.

=== Shell Script (`#`) Comments

- Pattern:

[source]
----
#!{shebang line}
...
# Copyright (c) ...
----
- If such a block occurs in the first 20 lines, the lines from the initial `#` to just before the next non-`#` content may be removed. Don't remove the line starting with the shebang (`#!`).

== Test Scenarios (Parameterised)

Below are test scenarios (as seen in `AdocFileProcessorTest`) verifying each comment style:

. **No Copyright Found**
- Input lines remain unchanged.
. **AsciiDoc Comment within First 20 Lines**
- A block surrounded by `////` is removed if it contains “Copyright ...”.
. **Copyright beyond 20 lines**
- Ignored by the removal logic; the file remains unmodified.
. **Java Block Comments**
- Lines from `/*` to `*/` that include “Copyright” are removed.
. **Forward-Slash Line Comments**
- Consecutive `//` lines (including one with “Copyright”) are removed, up to the non-`//` line.
. **Shell Script Style (`#`) Comments**
- Leading or consecutive `#` lines containing “Copyright” are removed.

**Important**: Depending on implementation details, the entire “block” is typically removed if it’s identified in the first 20 lines. The exact definition of “block” can vary (e.g., strictly between `/* ... */`, or consecutive lines starting with `//`/`#`). Ensure tests confirm the intended boundaries.

== Implementation Notes

* If **multiple** potential blocks are present within the first 20 lines, only the **first** recognized block is removed (by default).
* The method currently assumes that if any recognized comment opening is found (`////`, `/*`, `//`, or `#`) and includes a line with “Copyright”, then the subsequent lines in that block are stripped until the block’s closing delimiter or a change in comment style.

== Example Flow

[.procedure]
----
1. Read file lines into a `List<String>`.
2. Scan up to line 20:
   a. Detect start of comment marker (e.g. `////`, `/*`, `//`, `#`) and check whether it contains “Copyright”.
   b. If found, remove those lines up to the block’s end marker (or until a different style of comment is encountered).
3. Return modified list.
----

== Future Enhancements

* **Configurable Markers**: A config or YAML-driven approach could let users define custom comment delimiters.
* **Partial Comment Removal**: If only specific lines should be removed rather than entire blocks.
* **Multi-Block Handling**: Removal of multiple distinct blocks within the first 20 lines, if necessary.
