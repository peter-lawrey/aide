== Overview

This document defines the functional requirements for the **GitignoreFilter** component, which processes `.gitignore` (or `aide.ignore`) files to determine whether file paths should be excluded or included.

== Functional Requirements

1. **Parse `.gitignore` File:**
- Support wildcards, directory rules, negations (`!file`), and relative paths.
2. **Ignore Comments and Blanks:**
- Skip lines beginning with `#` or containing only whitespace.
3. **Match File Paths:**
- Return one of the following:
- `IGNORED` – explicitly excluded.
- `NOT_IGNORED` – explicitly included.
- `DEFAULT` – no matching rule; further local checks decide.
4. **Precedence Rule:**
- The last matching rule in the file has priority.

== Integration

- **AdocFileFilter** will chain the GitignoreFilter logic with local filtering rules (overshadowing, size checks, etc.).

== Examples

[source]
----
# Ignore log files
*.log

# Include specific log file
!keep_this.log

# Exclude directories
target/
.idea/
----
- `*.log` excludes all log files.
- `!keep_this.log` forces inclusion.
- `target/` excludes the entire target directory.

== Non-Functional Requirements

- Must parse large ignore files efficiently.
- Must optimize memory usage for repeated calls.
- Optional debug logging for troubleshooting.

== Summary

The **GitignoreFilter** ensures that ignore file rules are respected and returns `IGNORED`, `NOT_IGNORED`, or `DEFAULT` accordingly.
