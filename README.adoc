== Introduction

AIDE (Artificial Intelligence Development Environment) pairs AI-driven code generation with a documentation-driven workflow.
It uses AsciiDoc as a single source of truth so requirements, tests, and code stay in sync.
AI handles repetitive tasks, while humans add domain insight and validate correctness.

See the <<aide-workflow,AIDE Workflow>> for details on iterative development principles and AI-human collaboration.

== Project Overview

This repository is a "Chronicle Build" sandbox for AI-based tools in Java.
Key features include:

- **Template Management** to handle AI prompt templates and text blocks.
- **Documentation-Driven Development** to keep the code in sync with AsciiDoc requirements.
- **Project Statistics** summarising text density and automatically substituting "full" `.adoc` with `.ad` versions when available.

Additional guidelines for coding conventions and commit messages can be found in the <<aide-style-guide,AIDE Style Guide>>.
Definitions of AI and domain terms appear in the <<aide-glossary,AIDE Glossary>>.

=== Highlight This Project as an Example

This project itself demonstrates an actual application of AI-enhanced, documentation-driven workflows.
Each `.adoc` file outlines the architecture and best practices, and the incremental build approach <<aide-workflow>> lets you see how newly added or changed requirements become part of the final `increment.asciidoc`.

This makes it easier to:

- Understand how the "document-first" approach is used in practice.
- See the concrete code and tests that align with the updated `.adoc` specs.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Java 11 or higher (recommended)
* Maven for building and testing

=== Installation

==== Clone the Repository

----
git clone https://github.com/peter-lawrey/aide.git
cp aide
cp -r aide {your-project-directory}
mvn install exec: Java -Dexec.mainClass=" com.example.tools.dc.AsciidocDocumentApp" -Dexec.args="{your-project-directory}"
----

Post to your chat App the following command:

----
Consider the following project directory and reply Got it

<<Paste the project directory here>>
----

Expected response: "Got it"

or to get started

----
Suggest improvements to this project

<<Paste the project directory here>>
----

==== Build the Project

----
mvn clean package
----

=== Basic Usage

* **AdocDocumentApp** Utility
Recursively scans directories, applying filters to list `.adoc`, `pom.xml`, or `src/` files.
It calculates line counts, blank lines, total tokens, and tokens/lines.
Results are summarised at the end.

I run `AdocDocumentApp` with a directory path as an argument in my IDE.
However, you can run it from Maven or on the command line.

- Replaces "full" files with `.ad` summaries when available.
- Excludes files and directories from `.gitignore`
- Excludes `.asciidoc`, hidden files, PDFs, and images.
- Aggregates stats (including GPT-like token counts) at the end.

== Example AI Prompts

Below are sample prompts you can give to a Chat App for `context.asciidoc`, including AIDE, along with the kind of response you might expect.
In each case, paste the `context.asciidoc` into the Chat App to see what it generates.

Expected (Summary of AI Response):

This is a close-up photo of dark-brown vanilla pods and roasted coffee beans on a warm, rustic wooden surface.
Some beans are cracked to show lighter interiors, and the wood's natural grain and knots create a cosy backdrop.
Overall, it highlights the rich, earthy tones of the vanilla and coffee, evoking their combined aromatic appeal.

Expected (Summary of AI Response):

- The AI generates a Java program using Chronicle Queue for low-latency event logging and processing.
- It includes a Maven dependency and a brief description of the Chronicle Queue.

Expected (Summary of AI Response):

- The AI generates a Java program using Chronicle Map for a high-performance key-value store.
- It includes a Maven dependency and a brief description of the Chronicle Map.
