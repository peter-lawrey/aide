== Overview

This document captures the key design decisions made for the AIDE toolset. It focuses on packaging, file filtering, token optimization, and contextual search functionality. Each decision is accompanied by the rationale behind it, and potential future enhancements are discussed.

== Included Requirements and Rationale

=== File Filtering via Ignore Files
*Requirement:*
The tool must consult an `aide.ignore` file (or fall back to `.gitignore`) and apply strict, non-configurable rules (e.g., excluding hidden files, binary files, overly large files, and files with disallowed extensions).

*Rationale:*
This approach ensures only relevant text files are processed, keeping the output lean and token‑optimized for AI ingestion.

=== Token Optimization
*Requirement:*
The packaging process must count total lines and tokens (using a GPT-like encoder) and include summary statistics (line count, token count, tokens/line) in a metadata header.

*Rationale:*
Token metrics confirm that the output is optimized for chat-based ingestion and prevent overloading downstream AI systems.

=== Contextual Search Integration
*Requirement:*
The **AdocDocumentEngine** is responsible for directory traversal and file filtering, while **AdocContextualSearch** operates on individual files. The search checks if the file name matches the search pattern (returning full content) or performs line-by-line analysis to extract matching segments with context.

*Rationale:*
This separation of concerns simplifies implementation and improves performance, ensuring predictable and precise search results.

=== Output Formatting and Logging
*Requirement:*
The final output must be clearly structured—with headings, line numbers, and distinct markers for direct matches versus context lines. A `-Dverbose` option should enable detailed logging.

*Rationale:*
Clear formatting benefits both human users and AI systems in parsing the results. Verbose logging aids in troubleshooting and understanding file inclusion decisions.

== Future Requirements and Considerations

=== Enhanced Smart Context Detection
*Description:*
Extend smart context mode to include robust detection of code boundaries via syntax analysis.

*Pros/Cons:* More precise context extraction vs. increased complexity and potential performance overhead.

=== Incremental Search Caching
*Description:*
Cache search results for unchanged files to reduce processing time.

*Pros/Cons:* Faster searches vs. additional cache management complexity.

=== Additional Output Formats (e.g., JSON)
*Description:*
Support machine‑readable formats for interoperability with other tools.

*Pros/Cons:* Improved integration vs. dilution of focus from the core token‑optimized output.

=== Parallel Processing Enhancements
*Description:*
Introduce multi-threading for improved performance on large codebases.

*Pros/Cons:* Better scaling vs. increased complexity in thread management and result merging.

=== Improved Error Reporting and Resilience
*Description:*
Enhance diagnostics for file processing failures with detailed error reporting.

*Pros/Cons:* Easier troubleshooting vs. potential log verbosity requiring additional configuration.

== Conclusion

By separating responsibilities among the components (file filtering handled by the engine and per-file content extraction by contextual search), the AIDE toolset achieves an efficient, token‑optimized workflow. Future enhancements must balance performance with added complexity.
