== Overview

The **AdocDocumentWriter** is responsible for writing processed text to the output AsciiDoc file while updating statistics (total lines and tokens). It also ensures that each file section is clearly delimited for downstream AI ingestion by inserting markdown-style headings and contextual search markers.

== Fields
- **AdocDocumentStats stats** – Tracks and updates the output statistics.
- **PrintWriter currentWriter** – The active writer for appending text to the output file.

== Behavior

=== open(String outputFile, boolean append)
- Opens or creates the specified output file.
- The `append` flag determines whether to overwrite or preserve existing content.

=== write(String text)
- Writes the provided text to the currently open file.
- Invokes `stats.updateStats(text)` to update statistics.
- When starting a new file section, writes a markdown-style heading (e.g., “# File: relative/path/to/file”).
- If contextual search is active, precedes matching segments with a “.lines [start, end]” marker.

=== snapshotStats()
- Captures a snapshot of current statistics for delta reporting.

=== close()
- Closes the writer, ensuring all buffered output is flushed.

== Usage Flow
1. The engine opens the output file (e.g., `context.asciidoc` for full mode).
2. A header is written (e.g., “= Directory Content”).
3. For each processed file, a markdown-style file heading and content are written.
4. After processing, snapshot and summary statistics are appended.
5. The writer is closed.

== Summary

The **AdocDocumentWriter** guarantees that the final output is clearly structured and token-optimized for AI chat ingestion by including consistent file delimiters and accurate statistics.
