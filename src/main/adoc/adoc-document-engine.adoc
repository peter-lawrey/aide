== 2. `AdocDocumentEngine`

Central orchestrator for scanning, filtering, processing, and writing AsciiDoc or text-based files.  
This version includes console output indicating whether **full** or **incremental** mode is active, as well as updated file overwrite logic.

=== 2.1 Responsibilities

1. **Detect Full vs. Incremental Mode**
- Checks if `context.asciidoc` exists. If yes, run incremental; if no, run full.

2. **Console Output**  
   - Immediately before opening the output file, the engine prints either:  
     ```
     Full mode: {contextAsciidoc}
     ```
     _or_
     ```
     Incremental mode: {incrementalAsciidoc}
     ```
   - This is a new addition, helping users see which file is being written.

3. **File Scanning**  
   - Recursively walks directories (using `Files.walkFileTree`) or processes single files.
   - Uses `AdocFileFilter` to decide inclusion.
   - Compares file timestamps in incremental mode (only new or updated files).

4. **File Processing**
   - Uses `AdocFileProcessor` to read lines in UTF-8, optionally remove recognized blocks.
   - Writes content with headings in either `context.asciidoc` (full) or `increment.asciidoc` (incremental).

5. **Statistics & Summaries**
- Maintains line, blank, and token counts with `AdocDocumentStats`.
- Prints a final summary, including lines, blanks, tokens, tokens/line, and skipped files.

6. **Error Handling**
- Skips unreadable files, logs them to a `skippedFiles` list.

=== 2.2 Fields

1. `AdocFileFilter fileFilter`  
   - Manages file inclusion (e.g., overshadowed `.ad`, large files, `.gitignore`).

2. `AdocDocumentWriter writer`  
   - Writes lines to disk in the correct AsciiDoc file (context or increment) while updating stats.

3. `AdocDocumentStats stats`  
   - Tracks total lines, blank lines, and tokens.  
   - Allows deltas via snapshot calls (`stats.snapshotTotals()`).

4. `AdocFileProcessor fileProcessor`  
   - Reads file content, optionally stripping recognized copyright blocks.

5. `List<Path> inputPaths`  
   - Collects paths (files/directories) for scanning.

6. `String contextAsciidoc` and `String incrementalAsciidoc`  
   - Filenames for full vs. incremental output.

7. `boolean removeCopyright`  
   - Controls optional block removal.

8. `long contextFileLastModified`  
   - Used to determine whether a file is “new” in incremental mode.

9. `boolean incrementalMode`  
   - True if `context.asciidoc` already existed.  
   - If true, only files with a newer timestamp are processed.

10. `boolean engineExecuted`  
   - Guards against multiple consecutive calls to `execute()` in the same instance.

11. `List<String> skippedFiles`  
   - Paths for files that could not be processed.

=== 2.3 Usage Flow

1. **Create/Configure**  
   Instantiate `AdocDocumentEngine` with references to the filter, writer, and stats.  
   Set `contextAsciidoc`, `incrementalAsciidoc`, and `removeCopyright`.

2. **Add Input Paths**  
   Call `addInputPath(...)` for each directory or file.

3. **Execute**  
   - Check for existing `context.asciidoc`.  
     - If found, set `incrementalMode = true`.  
       - *Prints to console:* `Incremental mode: increment.asciidoc`.  
       - Opens `increment.asciidoc` and writes a heading, e.g.:
         ```
         = Directory Content (Incremental Mode)
         
         ```
     - If not found, set `incrementalMode = false`.  
       - *Prints to console:* `Full mode: context.asciidoc`.  
       - Opens `context.asciidoc` and writes a heading, e.g.:
         ```
         = Directory Content
         
         ```
   - Recursively processes each path, filtering out excluded items.  
   - For each included file, reads lines, optionally removes copyright, and writes them with a heading:
     ```
     == File: filename.ext
     ....
     (file content)
     ....
     (delta counts)
     ```

4. **Print Summary**  
   - Append total lines, blanks, tokens, tokens/line.  
   - Lists skipped files if any.  
   - Renders the summary in an AsciiDoc block (`....`).

5. **Close**  
   - Closes the `AdocDocumentWriter`.  
   - Safe to call multiple times.

=== 2.4 Key Methods

1. `public void addInputPath(String pathStr)`  
   Adds a path to be scanned.  
   *If the string is blank or `null`, nothing is added.*

2. `public void execute()`  
   - Detects full vs. incremental mode.  
   - Opens the correct file (overwrites by default).  
   - Prints a console message indicating “Full mode” or “Incremental mode.”  
   - Scans each path (or walks directories), calling `processSingleFile(path)` for each included file.  
   - **Throws** an `IllegalStateException` if called more than once on the same engine instance.

3. `public void printSummary()`  
   - Appends a final stats block (lines, blanks, tokens) and any skipped files.  
   - Called after `execute()` finishes processing.

4. `public void close()`  
   - Closes the writer.

5. `private void processPath(Path path)`  
   - If `Files.isDirectory(path)`, recursively walks via `Files.walkFileTree(...)`.  
   - Otherwise, calls `processSingleFile(path)`.

6. `private void processSingleFile(Path path)`  
   - Checks `AdocFileFilter#include(...)`.  
   - If incremental mode, verifies `fileLastMod > contextFileLastModified`.  
   - Reads lines using `AdocFileProcessor`.  
   - Optionally removes recognized blocks if `removeCopyright` is `true`.  
   - Writes heading, listing block, and delta (lines, blanks, tokens).

=== 2.5 Unit Tests

Tests in **`AdocDocumentEngineTest`** validate the logic:

- **`testExecute_fullContextMode_noExistingFile()`**  
  Ensures a new `context.asciidoc` is created in full mode if none is present.

- **`testExecute_incrementalMode_existingContext()`**  
  Confirms the engine recognizes an existing `context.asciidoc` and writes only changed files to `increment.asciidoc`.

- **`testExecute_withNonExistentPath()`**  
  Verifies the engine handles missing paths gracefully.

- **`testProcessFile_unreadableFile()`**  
  Asserts that unreadable files are skipped without halting the run.

Additionally, the updated code ensures a **console message** is displayed for each mode:

```
Full mode: context.asciidoc
```
or
```
Incremental mode: increment.asciidoc
```

=== 2.6 Best Practices and Notes

1. **Single Run**  
   - Create a fresh `AdocDocumentEngine` for each scan.  
   - Once `execute()` is called, the engine disallows further executions in the same instance.

2. **Parallelism**  
   - By default, directory walks are single-threaded. For concurrency, you could split paths or manually parallelize.

3. **Testing**  
   - The included unit tests cover typical usage patterns.  
   - You can add integration tests to confirm the final `.asciidoc` merges if needed.

4. **Append Mode**  
   - Currently, **both** full and incremental modes overwrite their respective files (`append = false`).  
   - If you want continuous accumulation for incremental runs, change `writer.open(incrementalAsciidoc, true)`.

5. **Maintenance**  
   - Watch for performance if scanning deeply nested or large directories.  
   - `.gitignore` or `aide.ignore` usage helps exclude bulky or irrelevant files.

By reflecting these **console outputs** and **overwrite** semantics, this updated document aligns with the latest implementation of `AdocDocumentEngine`.
