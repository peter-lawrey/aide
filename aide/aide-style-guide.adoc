This guide outlines the core conventions for naming, coding, and documentation. By following these practices, the team maintains clarity, consistency, and an overall high-quality codebase.

== 1. Language and Wording

1. Use **British English** spelling (e.g., `colour`, `initialise`) in code comments, documentation, and commit messages.
2. Maintain a **professional, concise** tone; avoid slang or overly informal expressions.
3. Define all project-specific or domain-specific terms in a <<aide-glossary>>.
4. Use straight apostrophes, single and double quotes in code and documentation.
5. Code identifiers may use either British or American spellings as needed; consistency within a project is key.
6. When adding suggested improvements to `.adoc` files, use comment syntax like `// consider:`
7. **Document-First Approach**:
* As recommended in the “Next Level AIDE” post, write or update `.adoc` content as early as possible, either in parallel with feature development or even before coding (similar to TDD).
* This ensures the single source of truth is always current and that AI-driven code suggestions align with the actual requirements.

== 2. Directory and Package Structure

1. **Directory Names**: all lowercase; use hyphens or underscores if necessary (e.g., `my-project-utils/`).
2. **File Names**:
   * Java: match the class name (e.g., `MyService.java`).
   * Documentation: use `.adoc` (e.g., `project-overview.adoc`), with lower-case, hyphenated file names.
   * Configuration: `.yaml` or `.properties`, describing purpose (e.g., `app-config.yaml`).
3. **Packages**: all lowercase, reflecting the maven `groupId` and `artifactId` and subsystem (e.g., `groupId.artifactId.service`).

== 3. Java Code Style

=== 3.1 Formatting
1. **Indentation**: 4 spaces; no tabs.
2. **Line Length**: Keep to 128 characters or fewer if possible.
3. **Braces**:
   * Open brace on same line (e.g., `if (condition) {`).
   * Close brace on new line.
4. **Blank Lines**: Separate method definitions with one blank line; group related lines logically.

=== 3.2 Naming Conventions
1. **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `OrderService`).
2. **Methods and Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `processOrder`, `userName`).
3. **Constants**: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`).

=== 3.3 Comments and Documentation
1. Use Javadoc for **public** classes and methods, explaining purpose, parameters, and returns.
2. Only add inline comments (`//`) if the logic isn’t obvious.
3. Maintain descriptive commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add new caching layer").

== 4. Testing
1. Mirror the main package structure under `src/test/java/...`.
2. Name test classes similarly to their corresponding classes (e.g., `OrderServiceTest`).
3. Keep tests small, focusing on one scenario each.
4. Prefer parameterised tests for repeated logic.

== 5. Documentation (AsciiDoc)
1. Start each `.adoc` file with a title line (`= Title`) and optional metadata.
2. Organise content under headings: `==`, `===`, `====`.
3. Use `[source,java]` blocks (or similar) for code highlighting.
4. Keep lines concise, and highlight key points in bullet lists or admonitions (e.g., `NOTE:`).

== 6. Version Control and Commit Messages
1. Write short, clear commit messages in the **present tense** (e.g., "Fix login bug in UserService").
2. Reference issue IDs if applicable (e.g., "Fix #42: Add advanced search feature").

== 7. Additional Best Practices
1. **AutoCloseable Usage**: Where possible consider implementing `AutoCloseable` so it can be used in a try-with-resources block, ensuring deterministic cleanup.
2. **Template Management**: Use templates for AI prompts and text blocks to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

== 8. Summary
By following these concise guidelines—especially consistent clear Java formatting, and straightforward documentation practices—teams ensure a streamlined, maintainable codebase. Remember to evolve this guide as the project grows and needs change.
