This folder contains supplemental AsciiDoc files that guide usage, workflows, or style conventions for AI-based projects.

== Overview

----
aide/
├─ aide-glossary.adoc       → Terminology definitions
├─ aide-style-guide.adoc    → Project coding style guidelines
├─ aide-workflow.adoc       → AI workflow explanation
├─ examples.adoc            → Example using AI
└─ notes-on-using-aide.adoc → Notes on using AIDE
----

Refer to each `.adoc` for details:

* xref:aide-glossary.adoc[AIDE Glossary]: Definitions of key terms (tokens, AIDE, tokens/line, etc.).
* xref:aide-style-guide.adoc[AIDE Style Guide]: Conventions for naming, coding, and documentation.
* xref:aide-workflow.adoc[AIDE Workflow]: The AIDE approach to iterative, documentation-driven engineering.
* xref:notes-on-using-aide.adoc[Notes on Using AIDE]: Notes on previous revisions the AI can draw on for further suggestions.
* xref:examples.adoc[Examples using AIDE]: Sample AI queries using AIDE.

These documents are stored in version control alongside the code, ensuring they evolve together.

== Usage

Many of these `.adoc` files are included in the final `context.asciidoc` or `increment.asciidoc` (depending on whether you run a full or incremental build). Keep them as small as practical to avoid exceeding token limits in AI-driven tasks.
