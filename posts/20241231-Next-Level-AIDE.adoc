If it's worth doing by hand, it's worth automating.

Just because not everyone is (yet) a world-class developer; that doesn't mean we can't step closer to that expert-level space.
In this post, I will introduce AIDE (Artifical Intelligence Development Environment), a powerful workflow that merges AI-driven code generation with a sharp focus on documentation-driven development.
With AIDE, I tap into the best of artificial intelligence (AI) while respecting the real human insight needed for domain-specific logic.

The result? An environment that streamlines repetitive coding, synchronises requirements, code, and tests, and elevates your engineering game.

Here is a practical example of an https://github.com/peter-lawrey/aide[AIDE on GitHub] developed using it's own AIDE.

== Introducing AIDE: Merging AI and Documentation-Driven Development

AIDE transforms development by combining:

- **Prompt Engineering with AsciiDoc**: Clear, structured prompts guide AI to produce accurate, context-aware outputs.
- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Documentation as the “single source of truth” ensures alignment across requirements, tests, and implementation.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests validate outputs, forming a feedback loop between documentation and implementation.

At times, AIDE makes you feel more like a curator than a coder. Yet, this curation—refining AI-generated scaffolds and aligning them with domain-specific logic—delivers impressive results.

== Why AIDE Empowers Developers

=== Confidence in Documentation

Documentation is the backbone of AIDE’s approach. With a cohesive workflow:

- **Single Source of Truth**: AsciiDoc becomes a live blueprint, ensuring code, tests, and documentation stay aligned.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Incremental updates highlight changes, prompting immediate documentation synchronisation.
- **Onboarding Simplified**: New developers can onboard quickly, thanks to the always-current AsciiDoc artefacts.
- **Innovation-Focused Development**: By delegating boilerplate tasks to AI, developers focus their energy on problem-solving and optimisation.

=== Escaping the Rewrite Loop

A common pitfall in software projects is rewriting patterns or boilerplate code repeatedly. AIDE circumvents this by allowing AI to scaffold foundational structures, leaving human developers to refine and innovate. Imagine a future where your mental bandwidth is reserved solely for solving real challenges.

== The AIDE Workflow: A Seamless Feedback Loop

AIDE fosters a cyclical workflow that keeps requirements, tests, and code in lockstep:

1. **Document Requirements**: Start with AsciiDoc. Clearly articulate requirements to guide both AI and developers.
2. **Generate Tests**: Let AI draft test cases from the documentation; refine these for domain-specific nuances.
3. **Generate Code**: AI produces initial implementations, scaffolded from documentation and tests.
4. **Review and Refine**: Validate AI outputs, ensuring domain-specific logic and correctness.

The most precise way to define what is needed is in unit tests. The Source Code is about 20% human written as you can't be sure how to update the requirements to get it to do what you want. As you iterate, you can refine the requirements between updating the tests and code.

=== AI <--> Human Collaboration

The AI is adept at generating patterns and templates but lacks the intuition for domain-specific intricacies. AIDE leverages this by:

- Allowing **AI** to propose code and test scaffolds.
- Tasking **Humans** with oversight, refinement, and validation.

This symbiotic relationship ensures the resulting software is performant, accurate, and maintainable.

== The Role of Documentation-Driven Development

In the AIDE paradigm, documentation drives development. This contrasts with the common approach of documenting code retroactively. Here’s why this matters:

- **Synchronisation**: Documentation informs code and tests, reducing drift.
- **Clarity**: Explicit documentation fosters a shared understanding across teams.
- **Scalability**: Even in latency-critical applications, robust documentation ensures cross-team alignment without unnecessary overhead.

Consider a scenario where sub-millisecond latency is non-negotiable. Without precise documentation, minor misunderstandings can derail performance optimisations.

== Practical Considerations

=== Learning Curve

Adopting AIDE requires a mindset shift:

- **Documentation First**: Writing AsciiDoc before coding can feel counterintuitive but ensures clarity.
- **Guiding AI**: Effective prompt engineering is key. Misguided prompts lead to irrelevant outputs.

=== AI’s Limitations

While AI excels at repetitive tasks, it falters in nuanced areas:

- **Complex Logic**: AI struggles with advanced concurrency and domain-specific optimisations.
- **Token Constraints**: Large files can overwhelm AI models. AIDE mitigates this by generating concise `.ad` summaries.

=== Diminishing Returns

Initially, AIDE accelerates development, generating requirements, tests, and code. However, as projects near completion, diminishing returns emerge:

1. Early phases benefit from broad AI scaffolding.
2. Subsequent phases focus on synchronisation and refinement.
3. Final phases involve refactoring for maintainability, where AI’s utility diminishes.

The takeaway? Use AI for foundational tasks but expect manual effort for final polishing.

== Key Takeaways

1. **Leverage AI for Boilerplate**: Delegate repetitive tasks to AI, preserving your mental energy for strategic decisions.
2. **Synchronise Continuously**: Use AsciiDoc as the source of truth to align requirements, tests, and code.
3. **Iterate Strategically**: Small, frequent updates reduce complexity and ensure alignment.
